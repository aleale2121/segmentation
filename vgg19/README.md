# Image Segmentation with VGG19

This repository demonstrates the implementation of image segmentation using the VGG19 architecture, a deep convolutional neural network renowned for its depth and effectiveness in feature extraction.

## Features

- **VGG19 Architecture**: Employs the VGG19 model, pre-trained on ImageNet, for robust feature extraction.
- **Image Segmentation**: Segments input images into distinct regions based on learned features.
- **Transfer Learning**: Employs transfer learning to adapt the VGG19 model for segmentation tasks.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aleale2121/Image-Segmentation-VGG19.git
   cd Image-Segmentation-VGG19
   ```

2. **Prepare the Dataset**:

   Organize your dataset with images and corresponding segmentation masks in the following structure:

   ```
   dataset/
   ├── images/
   │   ├── image1.jpg
   │   ├── image2.jpg
   │   └── ...
   └── masks/
       ├── mask1.png
       ├── mask2.png
       └── ...
   ```

   Ensure that each image has a corresponding mask with the same filename.

3. **Train the Model**:

   Update the dataset paths in the training script and execute:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

   This will initiate the training process using the VGG19-based segmentation model.

4. **Evaluate the Model**:

   After training, assess the model's performance on a validation set:

   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

5. **Perform Segmentation on New Images**:

   Use the trained model to segment new images:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --input path_to_image.jpg --output output_path.png
   ```

## Results

Include visual examples of segmented images and performance metrics to showcase the model's effectiveness.
